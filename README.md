ðŸ“ˆ Sales Forecasting Dashboard

This project focuses on building a Sales Forecasting Dashboard that predicts future sales trends using machine learning and data visualization techniques. The dashboard helps businesses make informed decisions by identifying patterns in historical sales data and forecasting upcoming demand.

Developed as part of my internship at Future Interns, this project helped me understand the end-to-end process of data analysis. From cleaning and preprocessing datasets to training predictive models and creating interactive dashboards for insights.

Key Learnings and Highlights:

- Cleaned and visualized sales data to uncover key business trends.

- Applied forecasting models to predict future sales performance.

- Designed an interactive dashboard for easy data interpretation and decision-making.

- Strengthened my skills in Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and machine learning.

Working on this project was an exciting experience that deepened my understanding of business intelligence and data-driven strategy.
